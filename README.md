## Cognito practice

### Client

run the followin commands:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
  
The client will take the api running in `http://localhost:8080` by default.
You can change this by editing the environment variable `REACT_APP_API` in the `.env` file.

### Cognito server
#### Requirements
You should have configured your default aws profile in your local machine, because it is going to take the default profile credentials.
